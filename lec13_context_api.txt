                              WHAT WE WANT TO STUDY FIRST

In this we will know about why we started using  context api before that we were using the prop drilling method why 
that method(prop drilling) is not efficient and not used as optimized way.



                            LETS KNOW ABOUT PROP DRILLLING METHOD FIRST 

Prop drilling => Prop drilling in React refers to the practice of passing data down through multiple layers of components
  in order to reach a component that needs access to that data.  
Ex- Suppose we want to pass a data in Card component whose location (Dashboard->rightbar->upper->card)  so what we do in this 
first we will pass the data inside dashboard to the required place using the hirerchy
    ex of prop drilling method->(        <Dashboard  title ="chai" />
                                          <Rightbar   title ="chai"/>
                                             <Upper  title ="chai"/> 
                                             <Card   title ="chai"/>       )           
So it is considered as an inefficient practice as passing the data in that component where it was not needed so another way 
come that is an optimizec way of passing the data in react is "context API"(context api is purely used in react)

Actually the prop drilling method was not only react problem but other library also faced this same problem like vue.js etc..





Context API =>
The Context API allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
Here's why the Context API is used and its main features:
Avoids Prop Drilling: In React applications, data often needs to be passed down through multiple levels of nested components.
This can lead to a pattern called "prop drilling," where intermediate components simply pass props down to their children without 
actually using the props themselves. Context API helps avoid this by allowing data to be accessed by any component within the tree
 without explicitly passing the props through every level.




Redux ->Its work is state management that is the data passes here and there it allows that work in  an orgainized way.
